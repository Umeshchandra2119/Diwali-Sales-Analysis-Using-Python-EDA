# Diwali-Sales-Analysis-Using-Python-EDA
This project demonstrates the process of Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using Python and popular data science libraries such as pandas, NumPy, matplotlib, and seaborn. The goal is to investigate and understand datasets by performing data cleaning, summarization, and visualization to uncover patterns, detect anomalies, and extract meaningful insights.

Key steps include data loading, inspecting structure and summary statistics, handling missing values, and visualizing distributions, correlations, and trends. This foundational analysis prepares data for advanced modeling and decision-making.

The project provides a practical example of how EDA helps data scientists and analysts ensure data quality and extract actionable insights for informed business or research decisions.
